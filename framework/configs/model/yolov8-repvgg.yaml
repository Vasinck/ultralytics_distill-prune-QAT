# YOLOv8-RepVGG-Lite: Ultra-lightweight model with RepVGG-style backbone
# Uses RepConv modules with reduced channels for maximum efficiency
# Key optimizations:
#   - Reduced channel widths (0.5x compared to standard)
#   - Straight-through backbone structure
#   - Inference: fuses to single 3x3 conv per layer

# Parameters
nc: 80 # number of classes
scales: # model compound scaling constants
  # [depth, width, max_channels]
